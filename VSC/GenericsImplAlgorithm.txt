All generics declarations are resolved & emited on-demand
	When the compiler encounters a generic declaration :
		* The compiler must resolve the declaration without resolving it's children
		* The compiler must link the declaration with the resolved symbol
	When the compiler encounters a generic specialisation :
		If the declaration is not bound to any generic parameter then
			* The compiler must clone the linked declaration
			* The compiler must specialize the declaration with the current new type
			* The compiler must resolve the declaration and mark it as emittable
		Else
			* The compiler must specialize all parent declarations
